## About Test System App

This app is created as a uni project and still needs to be optimized. Used are Laravel framework, several bootstrap libraries, JQuery by requirements.

## How it works?

With the help of question library, admins can create test templates, which are active and can be seen from invited users to participate only for limited time. Each test has maximal duration for execution. Closed questions are evaluated automatically from system, open questions need to be evaluated manually from the admin, who has created the test instance.
